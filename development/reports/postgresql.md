You're asking a great question about optimizing resource usage. Let's break this down:

1. Supabase: Comes with its own PostgreSQL instance, which is tightly integrated and optimized for Supabase's operations. It's best to leave this as is.

2. Sentry and Strapi: These could potentially share a PostgreSQL instance, but there are some considerations:

   - Database isolation: Separate databases provide better isolation, which can be important for security and performance.
   - Version compatibility: Sentry and Strapi might require different PostgreSQL versions or configurations.
   - Scalability: Separate databases allow for independent scaling.

However, if resource optimization is a priority, it is possible to have Sentry and Strapi share a PostgreSQL instance. Here's how you could modify the Docker Compose file to achieve this:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data

  supabase:
    image: supabase/supabase:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_postgres_password
      JWT_SECRET: your_jwt_secret
      ANON_KEY: your_anon_key
      SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: your_service_role_key

  sentry:
    image: sentry:latest
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    environment:
      SENTRY_SECRET_KEY: your_sentry_secret_key
      SENTRY_POSTGRES_HOST: shared_postgres
      SENTRY_DB_USER: sentry
      SENTRY_DB_PASSWORD: sentry_db_password
      SENTRY_DB_NAME: sentry_db
    depends_on:
      - shared_postgres
      - sentry_redis

  sentry_redis:
    image: redis:latest

  strapi:
    image: strapi/strapi
    environment:
      DATABASE_CLIENT: postgres
      DATABASE_NAME: strapi_db
      DATABASE_HOST: shared_postgres
      DATABASE_PORT: 5432
      DATABASE_USERNAME: strapi
      DATABASE_PASSWORD: strapi_db_password
    volumes:
      - ./app:/srv/app
    ports:
      - '1337:1337'
    depends_on:
      - shared_postgres

  shared_postgres:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres_password
    volumes:
      - shared_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  redis_data:
  shared_postgres_data:
```

In this setup:

1. Supabase still uses its own integrated PostgreSQL.
2. Sentry and Strapi now use a shared PostgreSQL instance (shared_postgres).
3. We've configured Sentry and Strapi to use different database names within the shared PostgreSQL instance.

This approach reduces the number of PostgreSQL instances from three to two, potentially saving resources. However, keep in mind:

- You'll need to ensure that the shared PostgreSQL instance is properly configured to handle the load from both Sentry and Strapi.
- You may need to adjust the PostgreSQL version to ensure compatibility with both Sentry and Strapi.
- If one service has performance issues, it could potentially affect the other.

Given these considerations, while it's possible to share a PostgreSQL instance, it's often recommended to keep services isolated unless resource constraints absolutely require sharing. The decision ultimately depends on your specific use case, expected load, and resource availability.
